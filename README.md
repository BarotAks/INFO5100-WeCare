# WeCare

## About the Project:

WeCare is a project created to use technology and the power of human relationships to give back to society. Our goal is to connect non-profit organizations and donors in the community through a new, simple, and direct system. The purpose of this system is to provide resources such as food, clothes, housing, and volunteer opportunities to homeless individuals. By efficiently managing and allocating these resources, we aim to make a positive impact on society.


## Problem Statement:

In 2022, the number of people experiencing homelessness in Massachusetts alone was 1,545. This data includes individuals living unsheltered on the streets, as well as those staying in emergency shelters, transitional housing, and domestic violence shelter programs

## Solution:

To address this problem, we have developed a system that connects homeless individuals with non-profit organizations and individual donors, with the support of enterprises and organizations. The system includes four key enterprises: Food Service, Clothes Service, Housing Service, and Volunteer Service. These enterprises connect with various organizations such as restaurants, colleges, distribution organizations, outlets, residents' organizations, and NGOs.

Our system efficiently manages the registered organizations and the services they provide to homeless individuals. It provides an easy-to-use interface for users and donors alike. With a focus on simplicity and user-friendliness, our solution aims to ensure that resources are allocated effectively and reach those in need.
